I want to understand how the brain works. Utilizing my computational/statistics background and fast-growing new experimental skillsets, I am determined to design scalable, open-source tools that address the end-to-end pipeline – from experiments to data analysis to sharing data with other researchers around the world for fruitful collaborations – and figure out how many discrete cell types exist and how they are connected in the brain, at the level of synaptic connections.

          Recently, researchers at Professor Ed Boyden’s lab at MIT demonstrated a proof of concept work for scalable neuronal mapping [<a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/229/25" target="_blank">1</a>].
          Known as Expansion Microscopy (<a href="expansionmicroscopy.org/" target="_blank">ExM</a>), this technique is a completely novel way to resolve nanometer scale structures of the brain
          on a conventional, high-speed, diffraction-limited microscope. By synthesizing a swellable polymer network within the specimen 
          and anchoring the biomolecules of interest (i.e., synaptic proteins, phospholipids, etc.) to the network, the molecules can be 
          physically separated thorough isotropic expansion, after the pre-existing bonds between them are disrupted with relevant enzymes
          and chemicals (i.e., Proteinase K, detergent, etc.). The materials used in ExM are the same as those used in water-absorbing 
          baby diapers, and the entire process is remarkably simple and inexpensive; furthermore, it has proven to be highly reproducible 
          across the world in the past two years. Boyden lab has improved ExM significantly, and today we can achieve ~20 nanometer 
          resolution with this method and demonstrated its potential applications in addressing proteomics and in-situ sequencing [<a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/251/25" target="_blank">2</a>,

          <a href="http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/264/25" target="_blank">4</a>].
          Due to its ease of use and diverse functionality, ExM has the potential to become the most ideal imaging technique for 
          addressing connectomics.

          Here, I have been sitting in chemistry, physics, biology, and neuroscience classes and reading stacks of relevant textbooks 
          and papers to learn the experimental procedures behind brain mapping. Although getting up to speed with lab work has been 
          exceptionally challenging, I have been making a great progress; I am now independently conducting experiments, where I 
          optimize chemical tags for identifying and imaging key biomolecules in the mouse brain with ExM. In addition, I am also 
          actively involved in projects conducting in-situ RNA sequencing in the brain, and recently I realized that the spatial 
          information of RNA obtained from this method can be used as an efficient, complementary training set for Google’s 
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00421" target="_blank">Flood Filling</a> algorithm for scalable neuronal segmentation. 
          Furthermore, with my statistical computing background, I have been constructing an experimental pipeline for seamless data 
          processing. Essentially, I am integrating our low-cost fluorescent microscope with a toolbox of algorithms that allow anyone 
          without in-depth knowledge in statistics or computer science to easily perform advanced image analyses, such as 3D 
          deconvolution and high-definition range imaging. Gaining intuition from the web labs has been crucial to coming up with these 
          plans for integrating statistical learning with brain imaging.

          I used various time-series machine learning techniques to build a forecasting model (monthly temporal resolution) managing 
          the military's personnel budget (around $15B). Implementation of the model has been saving around $20M annually for the military. 
          During the process, I built a dynamic programming econometrics model for predicting each military personnel's future 
          stay/leave behavior and convined the policy makers to adopt the model nationwide. <i>Publication in preparation.</i>

          <i>Ministry of National Defense</i>, South Korea

          I created a predictive model for estimating the suicide risk of soldiers based on their physiological data. Although 
          military doctors and counselors had already collected 
          the necessary data for analysis, I did not believe in expecting meaningful results without having
          in-depth contextual understanding of the data. Therefore, I random-sampled soldiers whenever possible to personally 
          conduct the analysis as well. The model out-performed the original model by 140% AUC-ROC chart basis. After the model 
          was implemented at the military, the suicide rate decreased by 27%, 
          as compared to the 10-year average. The Korea National Assembly’s ethics committee was also convinced that the budget for 
          psychotherapy should be increased. The rate has been continuously decreasing since then, and for this effort, I also 
          received Ministerial Citation, one of the highest honors a soldier could receive.

         used vector autoregression techniques to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series data.
